			<h3 class="w3-text-shadow">Tips for a Successful Show</h3>
		
			<ol>
				<li>When you’re placing your art on the grid wall, always start with your largest pieces working down from the top. If you place everything on the wall in size order it’s easier to break down later. If possible, group art by themes (landscapes with landscapes, nautical with nautical etc.) for maximum aesthetic value.</li>
				
				<li>Nothing is more frustrating that people who walk past your booth or tent and don’t even look inside. You can fix this by having a Showpiece. This is your best, brightest and most colorful piece of art. This is the piece you would (and should) enter into any art competition. If this is a piece that has won any competitions, show off those ribbons. Showpieces that have won a competition are a sure-fire way of getting people in to see your other work. Don’t forget – those competitions award various sized cash prizes. Prize profits are just as good sales, and will equate to more sales in the future.</li>
				
				<li>This next tip I would consider my second-to-best piece of advice I would give any artist in any visual medium. You can print up and hang pieces with a $300 plus price tag but the odds of them selling in this slim economy are just that – slim. Someday you will sell them and go home with a sizable payday, but those days will be few and far between. I don’t lie when I say I price to sell. I don’t depend on a big price-tag item to come off the wall. Instead, get yourself a good card rack and sell cards. I started out with cards in baskets on my table then graduated first to a table top show card rack and then bought a full sized gift shop card rack and I fill them up. I’ve had very profitable days where I never sell even a low priced item off the wall. It is much easier to sell a lot of three dollar cards than to sell a $300 print. Most of the time, artist with nothing but big ticket items don’t make enough money to pay for their booth.</li>
			</ol>

		<h3 class="w3-text-shadow">And the Most Important Piece of Advice – Don’t Give Up!</h3>
		
		<p>This is important. This happens to me often and it is especially important with two day shows. You’re having a crummy show. Someone forgot to advertise on social media, it rained at an outdoor show, no one seems interested. It happens. Do not give up. Do not be the person who packs up and leave an hour early because they give up. I’ve done weekend shows that two days in, I haven’t made anything but card money and then last hour of a show can be the time that everyone decides they are done looking and they are now ready to pull out the checkbook! If you don’t stick to it until the very end, you could be walking away from money. Of all the things that will transform you from an artist going in the “starving” direction into an artist who is going in the “successful” direction is simply having the right attitude.</p>
