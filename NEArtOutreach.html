			<p class="description">Flat out, I have not had positive experiences having my art sold in galleries in New Hampshire for multiple reasons. First and foremost it’s very competitive and there are still a lot of artists and galleries who don’t promote photography as much as they do oil paintings, acrylic paintings and other mediums. One thing to remember is certain artistic mediums, regardless of the quality of the art, sell higher than other mediums. Oil paintings tend to be the top of the art money food chain. Photographers suffer two disadvantages when looking to sell in galleries: many local galleries will either consider digital photography as “all done by the computer” or they don’t take photographers work at all because they see no money in it. Gallery fees are typically the high end of 25%-33%.  I spent a summer babysitting a fledgling art gallery for a non-profit art association in Nashua. They waived their fees for free work, but I had no control over promotions. As a result the gallery got very little traffic and I sold one photo all summer.</p>
		
			<p>There is one idea that I am working towards as part of my business plan that would serve the same purpose of utilizing an art gallery while actually helping the community and reaching a potentially greater number of people with less overhead. New England Art Outreach is a non-profit organization that matches hospitals with artists so that artists have a new way of getting their art out into the community where it can be purchased while at the same time they’re beautifying hospitals and providing art to a place where it could be sorely needed. The therapeutic advantages of having art around the ill have already been documented so it’s easy to see how this program has been so successful. The program supports local hospitals by exhibiting artists and allows for some excellent cross promotional marketing.</p>
				
			<p>In short, as a photographer I’ve pretty much written off gallery space for a while until I’m better known. They are expensive and are not necessarily friendly towards photographers in the first place. I have found a solution that could potentially reach more people as well as finding a way to innovate my prints to give me a competitive advantage. I believe in the long run this is a better solution than even attempting gallery space again at this time.</p>
