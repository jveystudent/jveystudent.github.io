		  <h5>Is an Art Show Something You Would Like To Do?</h5>
	</div>

	<div class="w3-container">
		<p>If you are an amateur artist, and you’re thinking of taking things to the next level by doing a local art show, then this report may be for you. There are a lot of artists ready to take the leap from amateur to semi-pro, even pro, but give up because they do not do their research and prep work. Often you’ll hear the clichéd term of “the starving artist” yet at the same time they may be the artist who didn’t market themselves on the internet properly, didn’t run their booth at the show properly and as a result gave up on their endeavors too soon.</p>
	
		<p>There will be times where you will have, through no fault of your own, a bad show. The show runners may have over-booked or allowed resellers (people who sell art, but it’s not their art) in. It may rain at an outdoor show. Like a good poker player knows they can’t win every hand, a good artist working the shows know that not every show is going to be a good show. However, like a good poker player, you can minimize your losses and still come out ahead if you know what you’re doing..</p>

			<h3 class="w3-text-shadow">What Do I Need and What Do I Do With It?</h3>
		
			<ol>
					<li>Depending on your artistic medium, a way of hanging your art. I strongly recommend a type of grid wall. Many artists try to do things “on-the-cheap” and it shows. They will be forced to deal with an unprofessional wall they’ve made themselves. The wall will be hard to transport and harder to set up. The solution I use is a wall system I bought called grid-wall. It is sleek, professional, easy to use and set-up, fairly light, and very easy to transport. If you don’t have a truck bed handing, you can put a roof rack on the top of your car and be all set. You can assemble it into various shapes depending on the size of your booth and you can do it fairly quickly.</li>
					<li>If you have any intent on doing outdoor shows, get a good tent. A good tent does not mean new or expensive. Most show artists I know get their tents on Craigslist, usually at great discounts or for free. Just as many artists hang it up and call it a day with their show careers as pick it up. Keep your operation cheap, maximize profits, and get things you need used or free.</li>
					<li>Comfortable and professional looking clothing is important. Take into consideration that “professional looking” in an office environment and “professional looking” at a summer outdoor art show can be two entirely different things. In short – don’t be a slob! Always bring a change of clothes or at bear minimum a second clean shirt. When you have a sudden rainstorm while you’re packing up or if you’re doused in sweat after unloading in the middle of summer, it suddenly becomes your most important piece of gear.</li>
					<li>Always bring water and snacks. There is an excellent chance that there will be food and drink at the venue, but they can get pricey. Remember that the venue is selling snacks and drinks for money that you’re trying to make. Bring your own; it’s much cheaper.</li>
